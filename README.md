HELLO THERE

What is up?! 

that is great!

COOL

anyhow, here is this thing for parsing SVG paths

it works like this


    SVGPath myPath = parsePath("M0,0 10,0 0,10 10,10z");
    // OR 
    vector<SVGCommand*> myPath = parsePath("M0,0 10,0 0,10 10,10z");

YES, COOL RIGHT?
and then you can look at the class definitions for everything because I am lazy and do not want to write documentation at this moment. SO THERE.
